  <h1>Decentralization of the information</h1>
<br>
  <h3><em>A little trip in how the access to the information have evolved.</em></h3>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p>We have to start looking at how does everything works actually.
We all know that most of the people are use to live in a system that we have the power of decision coming from the
top to the bottom.
And if I tell you that we can change this a little bit?
And if I tell you that we can organize all of the decisions using an algorithm?
And if I tell you that we can took off the power from the hands of a little part of the persons and give to the common
sense? </p>
<p> For this we have to make a little trip to the past, when the internet haven't been created yet.
Our opinions were built by what they want to deliver us and from what they want to let us know.
An example, let's think about the politic. Our opinions were based in what we watch on TVs, in what we read in
paper journals or in what we listen in radios.
The big media used us to their interest. They make us think in what they want. They controled us. They blind us.
That's the centralization of the information. How many politics have been elected by the media? How many persons get
famous by the influence of the media? How many bad quality stuffs have been selled just because we saw in big medias?
They selled the image of persons, bad opinions, bad ideas, bad products and even more, bad perspective.
We have been slaved by what they want to deliver us.</p>

<p>I'll give you and practice example. I'm from Brazil. When you think in Brazil you think in beach, samba and football.
If you know a little bit of brazilian football you know Flamengo. Flamengo is not just a team from Rio. For the foreign
Flamengo is the biggest team of Brazil. Some places says that Flamengo has the biggest crowd of the world. And curiously
this team aren't the biggest winner. And why Flamengo is world known? Why everybody knows Flamengo and why Flamengo has
the biggest number of fans in all over Brazil and all over the world?
I'll tell you now.
Brazil is such a large country. But the most rich area is in the southeast of the territory. Everybody from other places
of Brazil goes to this part to get a good job. SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais. And for consequence, the teams
of this region have more expression.
And the teams from other regions? Well, like I said, Brazil is a large country and the pricipal championship can only have
a few number of teams, actually 20.
And who lives in where don't have a competitive team wants to be champion too. So they have to choose an elite team.
But we have a little problem. We have only one TV channel that reachs well every part of Brazil. And this channel chose
Flamengo to broadcast all the games and notices. And the effect is that. Think in a guy in the middle of Amazon forest,
that don't have a great team to be fan of, and then when turn on the TV, they only talk about Flamengo. Of course this guy would
choose Flamengo to support.
That's why Flamengo have this strenght.
It's just an simple example to how a centralized company can impact in their country and culture.</p>

<p>If we look for this case, we start to realize that exists a lot of other examples in all over the world. In every area,
in every culture, in every country.</p>

<p> Now the internet has come. Look how many "common" persons get famous and the TV stars get in forgotten. Can you imagine it?
Are the famous of the past really good enought to be in their positions? Or they were famous just because a centralized
company choose them cause of a beauty face?
With the internet we deliver the power to choose for the common sense. For the first time we had the mind free.
Now you choose wich content you want to see.
Now you choose wich person to follow their life.
Now you choose in what you want to believe.
Now you choose what you want. The truth are in front our eyes, is just we want to see.
<strong>With the internet we have decentrilized the information.</strong>
The old school politic is going down, now we can see the truth in the palm of our hands.
And not just in the politic. In the entertrainment, in the religion, in everything. </p>

<p>Think in how many good and talent people have died and haven't got any opportunity. Think in how many good ideas and
opinions has just disappear in the air...</p>

<p>We have to be thankfull to this technology, because we've been freed. Thanks internet to give us power. To give us
instantly access to all the information of the world, in the palm of our hands. </p>

<p>And what if I tell you we can go a little bit far.</p>

<p>The information is avaiable for everybody now, but we aren't completly free yet. Who deliver us all the information
keeps having control of the machine. If we start to look all the tools we have access we start to realize that this
tools are still under control of a small couple. We have the information, but how the information reach us still
been controllated. I can give you examples. Think in a place to find news in the internet. First of all you go to the
Google, a private company. And then you do your research. Google delivers you a lot of options. You click in the first
one. And then you go to an especific website, let's imagine, Bloomberg, a private company. Of course Bloomberg is one
of the most accessed pages. That's why appears in the top. And it's makes sense. But in most of time, before the most
accessed pages, appears the page who paid more to Google to be there. And again, it's makes sense. </p>

<p>But when you think by the way that Google can control what appears to you by their interest. It starts now to
don't makes sense if we think in the optic of freedom. We are still been controlated. Google is just an example. Inside
Google we have the Youtube, that can deliver us just what they think will be better for us by their interests. Of course
you have already heard about the Youtube Algorithm. If they don't like this kind of content, they won't put in their
homepage, even it's the most viewed video. It's a way of control. Of course we can go in the search bar and research
for this video, but youtube is a tendencious tool to put in the homepage what they want. And it's not real freedom.
And it heapens in Google, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and in every page of the internet that have an private
algorithm behind.They even can choose wich kind of content will profit more.</p>

<p>Now think about an platform that the algorithm is an open source, everybody have access to it, everybody start to
know how this algorithm works. The benefits are for everybody, not for just who goes in the way of thinking of the
platform. And if you are thinking it's won't possible, I have to tell you're wrong. The <strong>decentralization</strong>
now is in the producing tools. And I haven't start to talk about all the profits ($$$) of the platform are equaly divided
by the particiption of each user. It's looks impossible, no? No. It's happening already, they're known as <strong>dApps
(decentralized applications). </strong></p>
