  <h3>So, we have to begin from somewhere...</h3>

    If you are here, of course you have already heard about blockchain. If you haven't read yet the article thar I've selected
    you can click <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp" target="_blank">here</a> to read.

  <p>Resuming in simple words, blockchain is the network that connects and let registered all the transactions of the wire.
    Let's imagine the blockchain beeing the internet and the wallets beeing the computers. It's what connect everything.</p>
  <p>Blockchain is the chain of blocks. The blocks are the place that is everything registered in. Each block is
    cryptographed. After you encrypt an block, you register the code inside the next block. And then you
    encrypt again. And then register in the next one. And then you encrypt. An then you register. And then
  you encrypt. </p>
  <p>If you want access to the first block, you have to decrypt one by one till the first or till wich one you
    want to access.</p>
    <p>That's why it's a very safe technology that keeps saved more than a trillion dollars.</p>
